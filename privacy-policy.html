		<h1>Osmium Privacy Policy</h1>
		<p>
			It is understandable to be concerned when an application is asking access to manage your files and Google account.<br>
			This document is written to be easily read and understood by any user and to comply with the <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Google Permissions and Scopes</h2>
		<p>
			When making requests to Google's API, we ask for permission to different types of requests in the form of scopes.<br>
			A scope is essentially a bundle of permissions. We use as few scopes as possible to make our app work.<br>
			Here are the scopes we request access to and why we need them.<br>
		</p>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<th>Scope</th>
				<th>Permissions Granted</th>
				<th>Explanation</th>				
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>/auth/spreadsheets</td>
				<td>See, edit, create, and delete your spreadsheets in Google Drive</td>
				<td>Used to create new databases and edit the contents of existing databases</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>/auth/drive.file</td>
				<td>View and manage Google Drive files and folders that you have opened or created with this app</td>
				<td>Used to view and manage databases created with our app</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>/auth/drive.metadata.readonly</td>
				<td>View metadata for files in your Google Drive</td>
				<td>Used to search for databases in your Google Drive</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		
		<h2>Additional Google Data</h2>
		<p>
			It should also be noted that we use very basic profile data from your Google account to personalize<br>
			the appearance of our app when you are signed in. This includes your account email, name, and profile photo.<br>
			None of this data is ever stored and is simply pulled from your account each time you authenticate.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Data Collection and Storage</h2>
		<p>
			This app is a user-friendly interface for a Google spreadsheet which provides convenient data storage.<br>
			All user-driven data collection is sourced from and entered to the selected Google spreadsheet.<br>
			The app does not collect or store any data excluding user-created data within each Google spreadsheet.
			Its web interface is hosted solely on GitHub Pages, which does not support server-side data storage.<br>
			It does not communicate with any external websites or servers excluding Google's Services and APIs.<br>
