		<h1>Osmium Privacy Policy</h1>
		<p>
			It is understandable to be concerned when an application is asking access to manage your files and Google account.
			We highly value your security and privacy, so this document will explain to you what exactly we need access to and why.
			This document and application is written to comply with the <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Google Permissions and Scopes</h2>
		<p>
			When making requests to Google's API, we ask for permission to different types of requests in the form of scopes.
			A scope is essentially a bundle of permissions.
			We use as few as possible, and we don't use all of the permissions each scope grants.
			Here are the scopes we request access to and why we need them.
		</p>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<th>Scope</th>
				<th>Permissions Granted</th>
				<th>Explanation</th>				
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>/auth/spreadsheets</td>

				<td>Used to create new databases and edit the contents of existing databases</td>

		<h2>Additional Google Data</h2>
		<p>
			It should also be noted that we use very basic profile data from your Google account to personalize the appearance of our app when you are signed in. This includes your account email, name, and profile photo.
