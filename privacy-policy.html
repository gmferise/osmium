		<h1>Osmium Privacy Policy</h1>
		<h2>Scopes We Use</h2>
		<p>
			It is understandable to be concerned when an application is asking access to manage your files.
			We highly value your security and privacy, so this document will explain to you what exactly we need access to and why.
		</p>
		<p>
			When performing actions with Google's API, we must enable certain scopes.
			A scope is essentially a package of permissions.
			We use as few as possible, and we don't use all of the permissions each scope grants.
			Here are the scopes we use and why.
		</p>
