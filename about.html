		<h1>About Osmium</h1>
		<h2>Purpose</h2>
		<p>
			Osmium is a user-friendly interface for using Google Sheets as a database.<br>
			It was created as a school project for the Hamilton Southeastern Highschool Library in the Software Development course.<br>
			Its main use is for the library to monitor traffic flow through the library and common uses of the library.<br>
			Touch-screen kiosks are set up at each entrance to the library and students are asked to use their student id to sign in and out of the library.<br>
			Librarians have the opportunity to assist students seeking technology help, sending them to the building techs if they are unable to resolve the issue.<br>
		</p>
		<h2>Developers</h2>
		<p>	
			We are highschool seniors pursuing a career in software development.
